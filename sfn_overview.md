- Greymatters journal
    - undergrad search journal? community building free education about technology? neuroscience community building, excited because we're open-source. 
- Qin Li - on every mailing list
- Josh Kaplan - WWU 
- Erica Marks - tamu@edu - mouse 3d gaze/eye tracking
- Niloufar Faridani - wants to do a PhD internship related to vision/motion tracking
- Emma Gibbers - real-time saccade detection 
- Samuel Tukua @MIT
- Agustin Solano 
- Pedro Martinez 
- Bianca Marlin* - needs eye tracking + free movement - was running very fast by the booth, but was very excited and said we should definitely talk. Cool scarf. 
- Sebastian Tremblay - single camera tracking tasks on an iPad front facing camera
- Ruiying Cheng - looking for work 
- Aniket Jangam - northwell.edu (volunteer/hire for lab)
- Tanmai Dhanireddy - rochester, maybe vision
- Chris Shang? - USCD - first year grad student, might do real time tracking
- Ken Wang - princeton
- *Sarah Jessen, Malte Wostmann - neuroinfant/neurological conditions, very interested, wanted to ask about putting on us on their grants
- Burgundy Waiters - mouse eye tracking 
- Jake Joseph - umichigan real-time NHP hand tracking
- Sabrina Pires - former ferrets, gaze tracking in mice 
- Ed Moraud* - Swedish, does gait in parkinsons, very very interested
- Valeriya Gritsenko* - baby remote monitoring
- Netholabs* - private industry, has $
- Pierre Pouget - video-eyetracker calibration poster recommendation from Andrew
- SpikeGadgets* - Mattias Karlsson - wanted to give us $
- James Dong - SpikeGadgets adjacent 
- Virginia Chu, VCU - baby/infant monitoring
- Seyed Shirazi - LSL, let's write a grant together 
- Fatima Haidar - curious about triyng to get mice tracking in her lab (would be trying stuff herself, probably a lot free labor on our part)
- Yukio Nishimara - studying humans and macaques ephys, super interested in setting something up. Seemed interested in our help in building
- Greg Gage - Backyard Brains - perhaps somewhat interested in selling a mocap package, send some information about that
- Hyunjeong Lee - real-time implementation, had already looked the github wanted to know where RT implementation was 
- Tyler Johnson - Cleveland FES, does hand tracking in rehab. Didn't leave an email, but might reach out 
- Donald Woodward - old guy, should follow up, unfortunately his email may questionably have numbers in it so need some decrypting of his handwriting
- Barbara Marebwa - Michael J Fox, focus on PD, wants to see a validation paper - they do subtle mmovements in tremors. They've tried mocap in the past and have moved on a bit from that solution, but interesting results may convince them
- Matthias Krenn - one of two from Jackson MS - using, or planning to use FreeMoCap for therapy/rehab work - curious about multiperson for having a therapist in the video.
- Jonathan Shulgac - hand decoder, talking about trying to get 3d hand tracking - couldn't figure out how to calibrate
- Katelyn Miyasaki - writer/blogger
- Andre Bastos - impact tracking
- Enrico Opri - U mich, rapid accent guy, but we did not remember what he does
- Veronica Alonso - 3D top down rat tracking
